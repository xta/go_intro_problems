# Problem 4

### Usage

    cd go_intro_problems/problem_4
    go run matrixMultiplication.go 

implement matrix multiplication in Go: given an input file with lines in the form of "i j k", where i is row number, j is the column number and k is the value at row i, col j; then: if it is a square matrix, multiply it by its transpose otherwise return an error; use arrays for the matrices (and not slices);

    i: row
    j: column
    k: value

Example output for #4:

    octave:1> A = [1 2 3; 2 2 2; -1 0 1]
    A =
       1   2   3
       2   2   2
      -1   0   1

    octave:2> A'
    ans =
       1   2  -1
       2   2   0
       3   2   1

    octave:3> A*A'
    ans =
       14   12    2
       12   12    0
        2    0    2

The #4 exercise is a bit contrived, the arrays may not be the best option for matrices (it depends on whether they are sparse or dense) but the point of the exercise is to get familiar with arrays vs. slices. So please try and find a way to use arrays even if it feels suboptimal. To simplify the problem, it should only handle matrices up to 10x10.

Use nothing but the standard library, you shouldn't need anything else to implement these. Try to keep things simple, always asking yourself "what's the simplest thing that would work?". That would be in the spirit of Go, and should lead you on the right path. And have fun! :)
