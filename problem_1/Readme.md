# Problem 1

### Usage

write a go implementation of the md5sum program (in short, given a filename it outputs an md5 hash of its content)

    run path/to/md5sum.go

bonus points if you can feed it by piping into it (cat file.txt | ./md5sum) or feed it from standard input (./md5sum < file.txt)

    ...

more bonus points if it can print an md5sum of itself if given no parameters at all :)
